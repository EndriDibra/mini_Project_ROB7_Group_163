The prompt used to ask LLMs to generated a socially aware and optimal path is:

Prompt:

Scenario: A person (or autonomous agent) must navigate from a starting point (green Dot) to a goal point (blue Dot) within a defined space containing obstacles (Chairs) and static people (Figures). The goal of the navigation is to be socially aware, meaning the path must respect social norms (like maintaining a personal space buffer around people) while simultaneously seeking the shortest possible path that adheres to those norms.


Task:

Analyze the original image provided (showing the layout of chairs, people, and the start/end dots).

Illustrate the optimal path that balances social awareness and path length by drawing a Red Line connecting the green Dot to the blue Dot. The path should clearly loop around people to avoid violating their personal space.

Provide a brief justification for the illustrated path, explaining which social norms were prioritized over raw distance, and why the path chosen is more optimal than a simple straight line.

Constraint: The resulting image must include all original elements (people, chairs, bounding boxes, and the two dots) plus the new Red Path.
